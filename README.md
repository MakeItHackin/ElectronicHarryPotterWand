Have fun and make it yours unique!  

Below is a list of the materials and equipment needed to make the Electronic Interactive Wand.  The $5 per wand cost may be achieved when buying items in bulk and making multiple wands or using materials you already own.  Make some with your friends!  

After you get the materials and equipment, watch the video again for the step-by-step instructions.  

Note: You can use a colored LED to make your wand light up if you don't plan on using your wand at the theme park.  You also can leave off all of the electronics if you just want a decorative wand!
